# Great Licks Ice Cream Delivery

## Description

In this project, we made use of everything we have learned in class so far to build a storefront for a hypothetical online ice cream shop. This wedsite uses React to create a responsive and dynamic user interface, Stripe to accept payments, as well as vite, graphQL, and JWT, which allow users to create accounts, stay logged in, and shop with ease.
