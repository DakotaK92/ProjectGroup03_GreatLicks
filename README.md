# Great Licks Ice Cream Delivery

## Description

In this project, we made use of everything we have learned in class so far to build a storefront for a hypothetical online ice cream shop. This wedsite uses React to create a responsive and dynamic user interface, Stripe to accept payments, as well as vite, graphQL, and JWT, which allow users to create accounts, stay logged in, and shop with ease.

To install this site on your local device, download the code from the [repository](https://github.com/wiph2004/ProjectGroup03_GreatLicks) and open it in your terminal or git bash. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then use `npm run seed` and `npm run development` to seed the files and start the site running on your local host. Make sure that you have node.js and mongoDB installed on your machine as well!

## Usage

The site is live and [deployed on Render](https://projectgroup03-greatlicks.onrender.com/).

Usage is straight forward: users can create an account, browse the shop, and checkout securely with Stripe.

## Credits

This site was built by [Jared Banks](https://github.com/wiph2004), [Dakota King](https://github.com/DakotaK92), and [Jessica Jones](https://github.com/distractabee).

The bulk of the code for the shop came from a class exercise on reviewing JWT token usage, mainly file structure and javascript for the project. Custom CSS and graphics were created for the project.
